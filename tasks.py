# 1. Log Analyzer
# Objective: Parse server logs (or custom logs) to extract insights.
# Concepts Covered: File handling, string manipulation, data filtering, dictionaries.
# Tasks:
# Create a function that reads and parses a sample log file.
# Extract and count occurrences of each status code (e.g., 200, 404).
# Identify top IP addresses by request frequency.
# Difficulty: Easy

# 2. Sales Data Summarizer
# Objective: Process a CSV file of sales records and summarize key metrics.
# Concepts Covered: File handling, csv module, dictionaries, data aggregation.
# Tasks:
# Load a CSV file with fields like Date, Product, Price, Quantity.
# Summarize the data, e.g., calculate total sales for each product.
# Find the most profitable product and the day with the highest sales.
# Difficulty: Easy to Medium

# 3. Mini ETL Pipeline Simulation
# Objective: Simulate a simplified ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
# Concepts Covered: Data transformation, JSON, list comprehensions, error handling.
# Tasks:
# Read JSON files representing user data (name, age, purchase history).
# Filter users based on certain criteria (e.g., age).
# Transform and store the data in a different format, such as a cleaned-up JSON or CSV.
# Difficulty: Medium

# 4. Weather Data Analysis (API)
# Objective: Pull and analyze weather data using a public API.
# Concepts Covered: APIs, JSON parsing, dictionaries, list comprehensions.
# Tasks:
# Fetch weather data for a city (use a free API like OpenWeatherMap).
# Parse the data to calculate temperature averages, high/low, and other insights.
# Optionally, create a command-line interface to let the user pick cities and date ranges.
# Difficulty: Medium

# 5. Data Aggregator for Survey Responses
# Objective: Process and analyze survey data to extract insights.
# Concepts Covered: Dictionaries, lists, conditionals, data aggregation.
# Tasks:
# Given a list of dictionaries representing responses, extract counts for each answer.
# Calculate metrics like average age or most common response.
# Display results in a clean format or export to a CSV.
# Difficulty: Medium to Hard
